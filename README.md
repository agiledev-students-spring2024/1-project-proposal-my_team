### Wearbnb

## What and why?
As a student studying away from Abu Dhabi, and a long-term resident of Abu Dhabi, I didn't own many winter clothes before my trip to New York. The climate there is hot and humid almost year-round, with temperatures on the coldest winter nights never going below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. As such, leading up to my semester in New York, I found myself buying lots of winter clothes that I would probably never wear again. This gave me the idea of a platform for users to offer their clothes for rent to others. In some sense, it is Airbnb for clothes, hence the name. This would not only be limited to winter clothes but everything from business attire to everyday clothes that their owner may no longer wear. Hence, those renting out their clothes can sustainably make good use of old clothes rather than throwing them out, and those on a budget can save money.

## For whom?
The end-users are divided into two groups: those offering their clothes for rent, and those seeking to rent clothes. The former would mainly consist of young to middle-aged students and professionals, likely of a middle-class socioeconomic status, as well as small to medium-sized fashion stores. The latter would primarily be made up of consumers of lower socioeconomic status, as well as frequent travelers and holidaygoers.

## How?
The system would essentially be a clothing marketplace, where users seeking to rent clothes can view a catalog of all items offered. For each item, the seller would list their asking price, the duration they are willing to rent it out for, location of pick-up, and the size--all of which would be visible to consumers looking to rent. A contact number could also be listed to open up communication. The display of items could also be filtered for end-users based on category, size, gender, location, etc.

## Scope
Creating an aesthetically pleasing marketplace that caters to both groups of end-users would not be too simple nor too complex. The main features are doable for a group of 4-6 programmers: the display view of all items, the filters, adding an item for rent, and the view of a single item with its details and photos. Other features could also be implemented if this proves to be simple enough, such as ratings and reviews on individual items and sellers, or a messaging service to allow for seamlessly arranging the transaction.
